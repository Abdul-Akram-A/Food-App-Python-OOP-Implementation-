# Project Title: Food App - Object-Oriented Python Implementation

## Description
This project is an object-oriented implementation of a food app developed entirely in Python. The app aims to provide users with a seamless experience in browsing, selecting, and managing food-related activities. Leveraging the power of object-oriented programming (OOP), the codebase is structured to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

## Key Features
1. **Object-Oriented Design**: The entire codebase is structured using object-oriented principles, enhancing code organization and readability.
2. **Modular Architecture**: Components of the app are modularized, facilitating easy integration of new features and enhancements.
3. **User Interaction**: Although the app does not have a graphical interface, it encapsulates user interactions within intuitive Python classes and methods.
4. **Data Management**: Utilizes OOP concepts for efficient data handling, including user profiles, food items, orders, and more.
5. **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing seamless expansion of functionalities and accommodation of future requirements.
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation accompanies the codebase, aiding developers in understanding and extending the app's functionality.
7. **Testing**: Incorporates unit tests to ensure robustness and reliability across different functionalities.
8. **Version Control**: Hosted on GitHub, enabling collaborative development, version control, and easy deployment.
